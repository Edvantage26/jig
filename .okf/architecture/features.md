Features replaced profiles on 2026-10-31 (see [profiles](profiles.md), deprecated). A repo turns
them on or off in `.claude/harness.json` (`features.<id>: true | false`); an omitted feature uses
its default. Each module declares `feature`, and runs only when that feature is on, unless the
repo switches the single module off with `modules.<id>: false`.

| Feature | Default | Modules | Ships |
|---|---|---|---|
| `okf` | on | `okf-index` (SessionStart), `okf-upkeep` (Stop) | OKF pack skills and agents, see [okf feature](/features/okf.md) |
| `danger` | on | `danger` (PreToolUse Bash) | see [danger guard](/guards/danger.md) |
| `core` | always on | `brief` (SessionStart) | — |

Feature choice is per repo because plugin options (`userConfig`) are stored per user only in
Claude Code; the repo file travels with the code. [/jig:init](/features/init.md) writes it.

Limitation: plugin skills cannot be switched off by a feature. With `okf` off, its hooks stay
silent but `/jig:okf` and `/jig:validate` are still listed.

# What it does

- **okf-index (SessionStart):** reads `<knowledge>/index.md` (default `.okf`), injects it (up to
  12,000 characters) with the maintenance rules, and records the HEAD at session start in the
  session state. Without a bundle it suggests creating one with `/jig:okf`.
- **okf-recall (UserPromptSubmit):** on every message from the person, ranks the bundle concepts
  against it (keywords without accents, 6-letter prefixes so plurals match; weights: title/tags 3,
  description/path 2, body 1, body words present in >40% of concepts ignored) and adds the top 5
  with score >= 3 to the agent's context, asking it to read the relevant ones first. Messages with
  fewer than 2 meaningful words and slash commands add nothing. ~25 ms on a 46-concept bundle.
  Reason: field data showed the agent consulted the bundle on only part of the messages once the
  session-start index was far behind in a long conversation.
- **okf-upkeep (Stop):** blocks finishing when the session left knowledge newer than the last
  bundle update: repo files changed since the session's base HEAD (tracked diff + untracked)
  modified after the newest bundle file, or project memories (`~/.claude/projects/<path>/memory/*.md`,
  not `MEMORY.md`) written **by this session**: the hook reads the session transcript
  (`transcript_path`, Write/Edit calls; incremental scan with the byte offset in the session state,
  ~0.5 s once on a 33 MB transcript, then ~0.15 s per stop) and, without a transcript, the memory's
  `originSessionId`. Other sessions open on the same repo share the memory folder; their memories
  are theirs to move. A deleted file is mentioned once per session. Asks once per set of pending changes (fingerprint in the
  session state). `.claude/settings.json`, `settings.local.json` and `jig.json` never count.
- **Validation gate (Stop, same module):** when the bundle was changed in the session, the hook
  runs the bundled validator itself (`python3 packs/okf/.../okf_validate.py --json`, ~0.2 s on a
  45-concept bundle) and blocks only on ERRORS, listing them; warnings (e.g. v0.1 legacy) never
  block. It also runs when `stop_hook_active` is set (the agent was just asked to update the
  bundle), which is exactly when it matters; the upkeep reminder itself is not repeated then.
  Loop guards: the same errors are reported once, and at most 3 validation blocks per session.
  Without `python3` it fails open (message on stderr).
- **Rules given to the agent:** update the concept and `generated: { by: claude-code/<model>, at }`
  with the real current UTC time; `log.md` only for lifecycle events; validate with `/jig:validate`
  and fix errors. On a v0.1 bundle: legacy warnings are expected, the agent must not migrate the
  bundle, and in each concept it edits it replaces `timestamp` with `generated`.
- **Field test (2026-10-31, copy of a real v0.1 bundle):** after a code change the agent updated the
  right concept and left `log.md` alone, but kept `timestamp` next to `generated`, invented the time
  and skipped `/jig:validate`. The first two led to the stricter rules above; the third to the
  validation gate. Verified in a real session: an agent wrote a concept without `type`, the hook
  blocked with the error, the agent fixed it.

# Skills and agents

From the [OKF pack](/packs/okf-pack.md): `/jig:okf`, `/jig:validate`, `/jig:visualize`,
`/jig:backfill`, and the agents `bundle-weaver` and `event-analyzer`.

# Coexistence with a standalone OKF setup

A machine may already have a standalone `okf@...` plugin and a global OKF guard hook. In a repo set
up with `jig init` and `okf` on, the standalone plugin is disabled in the personal
`.claude/settings.local.json` (no duplicate skills, nothing committed), and a guard hook should skip repos that have `.claude/jig.json`. Verified in
a real session on 2026-10-31: only `jig:*` skills listed, a single upkeep reminder.

# State

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/state` (else `~/.cache/jig`), files `<session>-<hash(project)>.base` and
`.reminded`, removed after 7 days.

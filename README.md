# jig

**The jig for your coding agent: same cut, every time.**

In woodworking, a *jig* is the guide that holds the piece and leads the tool, so every cut comes out
the same no matter who makes it. `jig` does that for coding agents (Claude Code first): it holds the
repo in place with guardrails, makes the agent prove its work before calling it done, and keeps what
it learns in the repo instead of in a chat that disappears.

> **Status: early (v0.2.0).** Per-repo features, the `okf` feature (project knowledge) and the
> `danger` guard work, are tested and verified in real sessions. Everything marked *planned* does not
> exist yet.

## Why

Agents are good at writing code and bad at three things:

1. **Remembering.** Every session starts from zero, so they guess, and a plausible guess is worse
   than an obvious error.
2. **Respecting rules.** A rule written in `CLAUDE.md` is a suggestion. The agent can forget it
   mid-session.
3. **Proving they are done.** "It should work now" is not evidence.

Hand-made fixes end up as a pile of loose skills, hooks and instructions with no owner. `jig` gives
that pile a fixed shape.

## The shape: four pieces

| Piece | What it is | Where it lives |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | Project knowledge the agent reads before working and updates after | The repo, as an [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/tree/main/okf) bundle (`.okf/`) |
| **Hands** | Tools the agent can use (CLIs, MCP servers), each with a connection test | The repo |
| **Trade** | Skills: how work is done (method) and what the domain needs (project) | Method in `jig`, domain in the repo |
| **Reflexes** | Hooks that enforce rules even when the agent forgets them | `jig` |

## Generic frame, project content

`jig` is generic because it only ships the frame. Each repo describes itself in one file,
`.claude/jig.json`, and the same hooks behave correctly everywhere:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Edvantage26/jig/main/schema/jig.schema.json",
  "version": 1,
  "features": { "okf": true, "danger": true },
  "trunk": "main",
  "verify": ["npm test"],
  "knowledge": ".okf",
  "modules": {
    "danger": { "ignore_rules": [] }
  }
}
```

Without this file jig stays inactive (the session start only mentions `/jig:init`). If the file is
invalid, jig stays inactive and tells the agent why at session start.

| Level | Examples | Lives in |
|---|---|---|
| Generic as is | Destructive-command guard, no `--no-verify`, secret scan, "verify before done" | `jig` |
| Generic with config | Verification command, what counts as production, trunk branch | `jig` + `jig.json` |
| Specific | Knowledge, domain skills, MCP servers | The repo |

### Features

Each repo picks its features; you do not need to write the file by hand:

```text
/jig:init
```

asks which features to enable and writes `.claude/jig.json` and `.claude/settings.json` (it
runs the `jig` CLI, so the result is merged and validated, not improvised).

| Feature | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `okf` | on | Project knowledge in an [OKF](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/tree/main/okf) bundle: loads its index at session start, asks to update it when the session changed files or saved memories after its last update, and ships the OKF toolkit (`/jig:okf`, `/jig:validate`, `/jig:visualize`, `/jig:backfill`) |
| `danger` | on | Confirms or refuses commands that destroy work or data |

## Components

| Component | Feature | Event | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brief`: tells the agent at session start which harness runs here | core | SessionStart | works |
| `okf-index`: loads the knowledge bundle index and its maintenance rules | okf | SessionStart | works |
| `okf-recall`: on every message, points the agent to the OKF concepts related to it | okf | UserPromptSubmit | works |
| `okf-upkeep`: asks to update the bundle after changes or new memories (once per change set), and runs the OKF validator itself when the bundle changed, blocking only on errors | okf | Stop | works |
| `danger`: confirms or refuses `git reset --hard`, force push, `rm -rf`, `--no-verify`, `DROP TABLE`... | danger | PreToolUse | works |
| `/jig:init` + `jig` CLI (`jig status`, `jig init`) | — | — | works |
| OKF toolkit skills and agents (from `packs/okf`) | okf | — | works |
| `prod`: blocks writes to production resources declared in `jig.json` | prod | PreToolUse | planned |
| `secrets`: refuses committing secrets | secrets | PreToolUse | planned |
| `verify`: no "done" after code changes without running `verify` | verify | Stop | planned |
| `jig doctor`, method skills (`ftd`, `review`) and a finding verifier | — | — | planned |

### How it works

Every hook event calls one entry point, `bin/jig-hook.mjs`. It loads `.claude/jig.json`, runs the
modules of the enabled features for that event, and combines their decisions (refuse > ask > allow).
A module is one file with `{ id, event, feature, run() }`; adding one does not touch the hook
wiring. Internal errors never block the agent; a matched rule does.

Requirements: **Node 18+** (hooks and the `jig` CLI) and **Python 3.9+** (the OKF toolkit scripts),
nothing else: no `uv`, no `pip install`, no network. PyYAML ships inside the plugin
(`packs/okf/vendor/`). Python 3.9+ comes with most Linux distributions and with the macOS
command line tools (the ones that provide `git`).

## Development

```bash
npm test                                  # node:test, no dependencies
claude --plugin-dir . -p "..."            # try the plugin in a real session without installing it
claude plugin validate .
```

## Principles

- **Mechanisms over prompts.** If a rule matters, a hook enforces it.
- **Friction proportional to risk.** Silence for the trivial, ceremony only where failure is
  expensive.
- **Evidence before claims.** Work is done when a command shows it, not when the agent says so.
- **No surprises on your machine.** Hooks are plain, readable scripts. No network calls, no
  auto-update, and no permission to commit or push on your behalf.

## Install

```text
/plugin marketplace add Edvantage26/jig
/plugin install jig@jig
```

Then run `/jig:init` in each repo. It commits nothing; commit `.claude/jig.json` and
`.claude/settings.json` yourself. The project settings enable jig for everyone who opens the repo:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "jig": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "Edvantage26/jig" } }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "jig@jig": true }
}
```

If you already use a standalone OKF plugin (`okf@...`), `jig init` disables it for you in that repo,
in `.claude/settings.local.json` (personal, git-ignored), so the OKF skills are not listed twice.
